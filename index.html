<h1> What is Creatine?</h1>

<p id= "para1"> Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in muscle cells. It helps produce energy during high-intensity exercise or heavy lifting. The body synthesizes creatine from amino acids (arginine, glycine, and methionine), and it's also found in foods like red meat and fish. Creatine is one of the most effective supplements for improving strength, power, and muscle endurance. It enhances performance by increasing the body's ability to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy source for short bursts of high-intensity activity. </p>

<h2> Can Creatine help build strength? </h2>
<p id="para1">
Yes, creatine is one of the most effective supplements for building strength. It works by increasing the bodyâ€™s stored phosphocreatine levels, which helps regenerate ATP, the primary energy source for short bursts of intense activity. This allows for improved performance in weightlifting, sprinting, and other high-intensity exercises, enabling athletes to lift heavier weights and complete more reps before fatigue sets in. 
<br> 
Additionally, creatine enhances muscle recovery by reducing inflammation and cell damage, helping individuals train more consistently with less soreness. It also promotes muscle growth by increasing water retention in muscle cells, making them appear fuller while supporting long-term gains.
